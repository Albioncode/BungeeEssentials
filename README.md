Hello and welcome to [BungeeEssentials](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bungeeessentials.1488/) by PantherMan594!
This project was originally created by Fireflies as a port of [The-Zip/LilyEssentials](https://github.com/The-Zip/LilyEssentials) for BungeeCord. Since then, it has gone far beyond just a port, thanks to the awesome suggestions made by the you, community! The latest version of this plugin is always available [here](http://ci.cubexmc.net/job/BungeeEssentials/).
